Attributes in DomainResource (id, versionId, lastUpdated, profile, security, tag, implicitRules, language, text, contained, extension, modifierExtension) are quite different than those in InformationEntry (identifier, subjectOfInformation, attribution, additionalText, recordStatus).

A clinical statement is composed of the StatementTopic class (grouping of attributes for capturing information about a procedure or a clinical finding) and the StatementContext class (grouping of attributes providing the context for the statement topic such as whether a procedure was performed, requested, not performed or whether a finding is suspected present or absent in the patient).
